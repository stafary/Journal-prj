This publication meets that need.

Brill Research Perspectives in International Investment Law and Arbitration	http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/24055778;jsessionid=EzB9TeabgRH2mGRM-j_FImj7.x-brill-live-02	http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/upload/2405576x.jpg	2405-576X	International Investment Law and Arbitration provides a systematic review of key topics in this increasingly important area of international law and practice. Foreign investment (particularly FDI) continues to be a catalyst for development. To promote and protect the flow of such investments, countries worldwide have entered into thousands of investment treaties and domestic investment laws, which requires them to protect foreign investment in their territories. These treaties also allow foreign investors to directly sue governments before international arbitration tribunals for treaty violations ranging from old-fashioned “expropriation without compensation” to violations of more modern protections such as the so-called “fair and equitable” standard of treatment. The claims raise a mix of public international law, private and public law, and public policy issues requiring an examination of the legitimacy of a government’s exercise of its core functions including regulatory (involving taxation, health, and environment), administrative, and police powers and the balance of those against foreign investors’ rights under the treaties. This journal addresses these issues and aims to provide an authoritative reference guide for scholars and practitioners.

Four issues are published each year, with each issue consisting of a single, short, in-depth monograph.

The place of religion in society, religious pluralism, the fear of religious extremism, and the terms and limits of religious freedom generate a host of important questions on the interface of law and religion. In response, law and religion scholars themselves recognise the need for interdisciplinary approaches to this developing field. Secular laws on religion, at the international and national levels, as well as their historical, political, philosophical, sociological, and comparative analysis, all form part of the canon of law and religion. Alongside these are the religious laws and other regulatory entities of religious traditions and organisations, all shaped by their distinct theological postures.

Central Asian Affairs	http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/22142290;jsessionid=dLy8Wc769Ee90_VfFMFHfKSs.x-brill-live-03	http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/upload/22142282.jpg	2214-2282	NOW AVAILABLE - Online submission: Articles for publication in Central Asian Affairs can be submitted online through Editorial Manager, please click here.  For the international community in general and the United States in particular, Central Asia remains one of the main sources of global instability, alongside the Middle East. University researchers and policy-makers do not have any joint space of discussion, whereas finding solutions requires interlinking approaches in disciplinary terms. The knowledge gap is immense, in particular concerning the link between strategic security issues, on the one side, and human security challenges, on the other. However, without any knowledge about these issues, the United States’ understanding of contemporary developments in Eurasia will remain imprecise. Central Asian Affairs hopes to fill this gap and become a major reference for policy-oriented and academic debates on this region.
