However, the journal emphasizes an agenda to publish hermeneutic, critical, ethnographic and language-focused original research and theory in information systems. We seek cultural and geographic diversity in studies of new technologies and uses that have a special impact on organizational communications, change processes and work practices, and that reflect the varying societal and infrastructural conditions in which information technology is deployed. We look for ways to perceive how people collectively conceptualize, invent, adapt, define and use technology, as well as how they are constrained by features of it. The journal has a primarily organizational focus, but publishes research relating to boundaries between organizational and societal concerns. "Cultures of information" is a topic that intersects industries, global regions and organizations, and is a new theme within our current scope. The emerging uses of IT in organizationally bounded teams and self-organizing groups, in support of software engineering processes, and for regional issues in electronic commerce, are topics which fit the theoretical scope and are an important area of current research.

Work that is purely algorithmic in nature is unlikely to meet this criterion and is likely to be more suitable to a journal in the management sciences or operational research. The journal encourages mixed methods of enquiry where appropriate and valuable in generating research insights. Irrespective of the mode of enquiry or methods used, the key issues are clarity in how the study has been carried out and rigor in the application of methods. Please note that any contribution should be based on good theoretical grounded framework as well be explicitly contributing to theory.Operations Management is defined broadly and includes the fields of supply chain and distribution management. Research studies in other topics including Product Design, Innovation, Technology Management, Information Systems, Business Strategy, Organizational Behaviour and Marketing, which have a strong operations focus and/or clear relevance and potential impact on the management of operations, may also be considered for publication in some instances.
